# RGLoader.xex - homebrew KXAM fixup tool for 360.

This is a mod to RGLoader.xex that adds OGXbox emulator support by turning on memory protection at the right time
Original code for RGLoader.xex can be found here: https://github.com/RGLoader/RGLoader-XEX

# IMPORTANT NOTES. READ THIS!
- if this dosent work for you, you need to patch your nand image. rgloader team got an adress wrong. i will post the patch how to soon(TM).
- while the Guide (hud.xex) works now, going back to the dash usually crashes the console unless you press B before Avatars are loaded. will be fixed (maybe).
- this is a beta and will probably crash here and there. please update me on crashes!

# How to use?
- Compile or grab latest RGLoader.xex form releases (https://github.com/552eden/RGLoader-XEX/releases#latest)
- replace your current RGLoader.xex. if you have a 16mb nand it will be in HDD:\filesystems\17489-dev\RGloader.xex. if you have a big boi nand, itll be in FLASH:\RGloader.xex. good luck with that lol.
